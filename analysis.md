## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue #1: Missing Statistics Keys

**Problem:**
run_cassette_system.py expects V1 optimizer statistics format, but V2 optimizer returns different keys.

**V1 Statistics (old per_cassette_cchannel_optimizer.py):**
```python
{
    'total_area': ...,
    'cassette_area': ...,
    'cchannel_area': ...,
    'cassette_count': ...,
    'coverage_percent': ...,
    'gaps_measured': 108,          # ← EXISTS in V1
    'adjustments_made': 0,         # ← EXISTS in V1
    'min_cchannel_inches': ...,
    'max_cchannel_inches': ...,
    'avg_cchannel_inches': ...
}
```

**V2 Statistics (new per_cassette_cchannel_optimizer_v2.py):**
```python
{
    'total_area': ...,
    'cassette_area': ...,
    'cchannel_area': ...,
    'cassette_count': ...,
    'coverage_percent': ...,
    'min_cchannel_inches': ...,
    'max_cchannel_inches': ...,
    'avg_cchannel_inches': ...
    # ← MISSING: gaps_measured
    # ← MISSING: adjustments_made
}
```

**Why Missing:**
- V2 uses adjacency detection instead of gap measurement
- V2 uses binary search instead of adjustment iterations
- Different architectural approach = different metrics

## SECONDARY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #2: Incomplete Visualization Statistics

**Line 87-94 in run_cassette_system.py:**
```python
vis_stats = {
    'coverage': stats['coverage_percent'],
    'total_area': stats['total_area'],
    'covered': stats['cassette_area'] + stats['cchannel_area'],
    'cassettes': stats['cassette_count'],
    'per_cassette_cchannel': True,
    'cchannel_widths_per_cassette': fill_result['c_channels_inches']
    # ← MISSING: 'cchannel_area' (needed for legend display)
}
```

The visualizer checks for `'cchannel_area' in statistics` to determine if it should show C-channel info in the legend. This is missing!

---

## PROPOSED FIXES

### Fix #1: Add V2-Specific Statistics to Optimizer

Add meaningful V2 statistics:
- `adjacent_edges`: Number of detected adjacent edges (68)
- `boundary_edges`: Number of boundary edges (96 - 68 = 28)
- `search_iterations`: Binary search iterations (8)
- `adjacency_percent`: Percentage of edges that are adjacent

### Fix #2: Update run_cassette_system.py

Replace:
```python
print(f"Gaps measured: {stats['gaps_measured']}")
print(f"Adjustments made: {stats['adjustments_made']}")
```

With:
```python
print(f"Adjacent edges: {stats.get('adjacent_edges', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Search iterations: {stats.get('search_iterations', 'N/A')}")
```

### Fix #3: Add Missing cchannel_area to Visualization Stats

Line 93 should include:
```python
'cchannel_area': stats['cchannel_area']
```

## DETAILED COMPARISON: V1 vs V2

| Aspect | V1 (Overlapping) | V2 (Non-Overlapping) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Gap Measurement** | Measures 108 gaps | Detects 68 adjacencies |
| **Coverage Method** | Sum (double-counts) | Union (correct) |
| **Adjustments** | Clamps violations | Binary search |
| **Optimization** | Gap-filling | Edge-to-edge |
| **Statistics** | gaps_measured, adjustments_made | adjacent_edges, search_iterations |
| **Result** | 103.65% (wrong) | 99.99% (correct) |

## EXECUTION STATE AT FAILURE

**Last Successful Line:** 66 (printed avg C-channel)
**Failed Line:** 68 (tried to access stats['gaps_measured'])
**Current State:**
- ✓ Optimizer completed successfully
- ✓ Results calculated correctly
- ✗ Printing incomplete (crashed mid-output)
- ✗ Results NOT saved to JSON
- ✗ Visualization NOT generated
- ✗ User sees incomplete output

**Impact:**
- User sees partial success but gets Python traceback
- No saved results file
- No visualization generated
- Confusing error message

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

1. **Immediate Fix:** Update V2 optimizer to include V2-appropriate statistics
2. **Update Integration:** Modify run_cassette_system.py to handle V2 format
3. **Fix Visualization:** Add missing cchannel_area to vis_stats
4. **Test:** Run end-to-end to verify complete success
5. **Optional:** Keep backward compatibility with V1 if needed
