## 1. Problem Definition

### The Core Problem

We are solving a **constrained 2D bin packing problem** with multiple objectives. Given a floor plan with rooms of various sizes and shapes, we need to determine:

1. **Which panel/joist sizes to use** (from a limited set of standard sizes)
2. **How many of each size** is needed
3. **Where to place them** for optimal coverage
4. **What remaining space** cannot be covered

### Real-World Context

In construction, floor and ceiling systems require structural panels or joists to span across rooms, providing:
- **Structural support** for loads above
- **Attachment surface** for flooring/ceiling materials
- **Path for utilities** (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)

These panels come in standard sizes (like 4×4, 4×6, 6×6, 6×8 feet) and cannot be arbitrarily cut or resized without compromising structural integrity.

### The Optimization Challenge

The challenge is finding the optimal configuration that:
- **Maximizes coverage** (minimal uncovered area)
- **Minimizes cost** (fewer panels, preferring larger/cheaper per sq ft)
- **Ensures structural compliance** (respects load-bearing requirements)
- **Maintains simplicity** (easier installation with fewer unique pieces)

---

## 2. Why This Problem Matters

### Economic Impact

- **Material costs** represent 40-60% of construction budgets
- **Labor costs** increase with complexity (more cuts, more pieces)
- **Waste reduction** directly impacts profitability
- **Time savings** from optimized layouts accelerate project completion

### Practical Implications

1. **Safety**: Proper structural support prevents failures
2. **Efficiency**: Optimized layouts reduce installation time
3. **Sustainability**: Minimizing waste reduces environmental impact
4. **Quality**: Better coverage ensures uniform floor/ceiling performance

### Current Industry Practice

Without optimization systems, contractors typically:
- Use **rules of thumb** that may be suboptimal
- **Over-order materials** to ensure coverage (10-20% waste)
- Spend significant time on **manual layout planning**
- Face **unexpected shortages** or excess during installation

---

## 3. Core Challenges

### 3.1 Geometric Incompatibility

**The fundamental mismatch**: Standard room dimensions rarely align perfectly with standard panel sizes.

**Example**: A 10×12 foot bedroom
- Cannot be perfectly covered by 6×8 panels (would need 1.25 × 1.5 = 1.875 panels)
- Using one 6×8 panel covers only 48 sq ft of 120 sq ft (40% coverage)
- Remaining 72 sq ft creates an L-shaped area requiring multiple smaller panels

### 3.2 The Hallway Problem

Narrow corridors present unique challenges:
- A 4-foot wide hallway cannot use 6-foot wide panels
- Even 4×4 panels may be inefficient (multiple seams)
- Long hallways (20+ feet) require many panels with many joints

### 3.3 Cascading Decisions

Every panel placement affects subsequent options:
- Place a 6×8 panel in a corner → creates specific remaining shapes
- Wrong initial orientation → may trap yourself into poor coverage
- Like Tetris, but you can't rotate pieces after placement

### 3.4 Multi-Objective Optimization

We must balance competing goals:
- **Coverage vs. Cost**: More small panels = better coverage but higher cost
- **Simplicity vs. Efficiency**: Fewer panel types = easier installation but potentially worse coverage
- **Speed vs. Optimality**: Perfect solutions take exponentially longer to compute

### 3.5 Structural Constraints

Real-world structural requirements add complexity:
- **Load-bearing walls** must be properly supported
- **Maximum spans** cannot be exceeded
- **Deflection limits** must be maintained
- **Code compliance** is non-negotiable

---

## 4. Our Solution Philosophy

### Hierarchical Decision Making

We approach the problem through a hierarchy of priorities:

```
1. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (Non-negotiable)
   ↓
2. GEOMETRIC FEASIBILITY (Must physically fit)
   ↓
3. COST OPTIMIZATION (Minimize expense)
   ↓
4. COVERAGE MAXIMIZATION (Minimize gaps)
   ↓
5. INSTALLATION SIMPLICITY (Reduce complexity)
```

### Adaptive Strategy Selection

Rather than one-size-fits-all, we recognize that different situations require different approaches:
- **Small, regular rooms** → Use proven patterns
- **Complex spaces** → Apply sophisticated algorithms
- **Time-critical decisions** → Use fast heuristics
- **Cost-critical projects** → Employ optimization algorithms

### Practical Over Perfect

We prioritize practical, implementable solutions:
- **98% coverage** is acceptable (perfect coverage often impossible)
- **2-5% waste** is normal and expected
- **"Good enough" fast** beats "perfect" slow
- **Buildable solutions** over theoretical optimums

---

## 5. Fundamental Principles

### 5.1 Structural First Principle

**Statement**: Structural requirements override all optimization considerations.

**Rationale**: 
- Building safety is paramount
- Code violations can halt construction
- Structural failures have catastrophic consequences
- Remediation is extremely expensive

**Implementation**:
- Identify load-bearing elements first
- Ensure continuous load paths
- Respect maximum span limits
- Verify deflection criteria

### 5.2 Shortest Span Principle

**Statement**: Panels should span the shortest distance between supports when possible.

**Rationale**:
- Shorter spans = less deflection
- Reduced material stress
- Smaller required panel dimensions
- Lower material costs

**Exceptions**:
- When coverage efficiency dramatically improves with longer spans
- When mechanical systems require specific orientations

### 5.3 Constraint Cascade Principle

**Statement**: Solve the most constrained spaces first, as they have fewer valid solutions.

**Rationale**:
- Constrained spaces limit options
- Early decisions cascade to affect later options
- Avoiding painting yourself into a corner

**Priority Order**:
1. Hallways (width constraints)
2. Small bathrooms/closets (size constraints)
3. Irregular shapes (geometry constraints)
4. Load-bearing areas (structural constraints)
5. Standard rooms (most flexibility)

### 5.4 Global Optimization Principle

**Statement**: Overall system efficiency trumps individual room perfection.

**Rationale**:
- Buildings function as integrated systems
- Material ordering happens at building level
- Labor moves between rooms
- Cost accounting is project-wide

**Trade-offs**:
- Accept 95% coverage in one room for 99% in another
- Standardize panel types across rooms
- Balance material waste with labor complexity

### 5.5 Acceptable Waste Principle

**Statement**: 2-5% uncovered area is normal and acceptable.

**Rationale**:
- Perfect tessellation is geometrically impossible
- Small gaps can be filled with cut pieces
- Diminishing returns on optimization effort
- Installation tolerances require gaps anyway

## 7. Optimization Strategies

### 7.1 Greedy Algorithm

**Philosophy**: Make the locally optimal choice at each step.

**How it works**:

3. Apply pre-calculated configuration
4. Fall back to other methods if no match

**Pattern Library Example**:
```
10×10 room → 2×(6×8) + 1×(4×4) = 100% coverage
11×12 room → 2×(6×8) + 1×(6×6) = 100% coverage
12×12 room → 3×(6×8) = 100% coverage
```

**Advantages**:

- Can learn from experience

**Disadvantages**:
- Limited to known patterns
- Requires pattern maintenance
- May miss novel solutions
- Depends on pattern quality

**Best for**:

- Repetitive projects
- Quick quotes

### 7.4 Hybrid Strategy

**Philosophy**: Combine strategies based on context.

**How it works**:
1. Analyze room characteristics
2. Select appropriate strategy:
   - Pattern-based for standard rooms
   - Special handling for hallways/bathrooms
   - Greedy for large open spaces
   - Dynamic programming for complex shapes
3. Post-process for optimization
4. Reconcile boundaries between rooms

**Decision Tree**:
```
IF room matches pattern → Use pattern
ELSE IF room is hallway → Use corridor algorithm
ELSE IF room is small → Use exhaustive search
ELSE IF room is complex → Use dynamic programming
ELSE → Use greedy algorithm
```

**Advantages**:
- Adapts to situation
- Balances speed and quality
- Leverages strengths of each method

3. Select best performers
4. Crossover and mutate
5. Repeat for many generations

**Advantages**:
- Can find novel solutions
- Handles complex constraints well
- Naturally parallel
- Improves over time

**Disadvantages**:
- Non-deterministic results
- Requires parameter tuning
- Slow convergence
- No optimality guarantee

**Best for**:
- Complex, irregular layouts
- Multi-objective optimization
- Research and exploration
- When traditional methods fail

## 8. Decision-Making Framework

### 8.1 Room Type Recognition

We classify rooms to apply appropriate strategies:

**Classification Criteria**:
- **Size**: Area in square feet
- **Aspect Ratio**: Length/width ratio
- **Connectivity**: Number of adjacent rooms
- **Text Labels**: OCR-detected room names
- **Position**: Location within building

**Room Categories**:
1. **Bedrooms**: 80-300 sq ft, aspect ratio < 2:1
2. **Bathrooms**: 30-100 sq ft, often 5×8 or 6×10
3. **Hallways**: Aspect ratio > 3:1, width < 6 ft
4. **Closets**: < 40 sq ft
5. **Living Spaces**: > 200 sq ft, often irregular
6. **Kitchens**: 100-400 sq ft, contains island/obstacles

### 8.2 Strategy Selection Logic

**Automatic Strategy Selection**:

```
Assess Floor Plan:
├─ Total Area
├─ Room Count
├─ Average Room Size
├─ Pattern Match Ratio
└─ Complexity Score

IF pattern_match_ratio > 70%:
    → Use Pattern-Based
ELSE IF total_area < 1500 sq ft AND rooms < 10:
    → Use Dynamic Programming (can afford optimal)
ELSE IF total_area > 5000 sq ft OR rooms > 30:
    → Use Greedy (need speed)
ELSE:
    → Use Hybrid (balanced approach)
```

### 8.3 Panel Selection Logic

**For each room space**:

```
1. Calculate available dimensions
2. For each panel size (largest to smallest):
   a. Check if panel fits
   b. Calculate coverage efficiency
   c. Calculate cost efficiency
   d. Consider structural requirements
3. Select panel that maximizes:
   Score = w₁·Coverage + w₂·(1/Cost) + w₃·StructuralFit
4. Place panel and update remaining space
5. Repeat until space is filled or no panels fit
```

### 8.4 Orientation Decision

**Determining panel orientation**:

```
Primary Factors:
├─ Span Direction (shortest distance between supports)
├─ Room Shape (align with longest dimension)
├─ Adjacent Panels (maintain alignment)
└─ Structural Requirements (load distribution)

Decision Matrix:
- IF structural span dictates → Follow span direction
- ELSE IF room is narrow → Orient along length
- ELSE IF adjacent panels exist → Match orientation
- ELSE → Choose orientation maximizing coverage
```
